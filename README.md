# EitherNet

A pluggable sealed API result type for modeling [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) responses.

## Usage

By default, Retrofit uses exceptions to propagate any errors. This library leverages Kotlin sealed types
to better model these responses with a type-safe single point of return and no exception handling needed!

The core type for this is `ApiResult<out T, out E>`, where `T` is the success type and `E` is a possible
error type.

`ApiResult` has two sealed subtypes: `Success` and `Failure`. `Success` is typed to `T` with no
error type and `Failure` is typed to `E` with no success type. `Failure` in turn is represented by
four sealed subtypes of its own: `Failure.NetworkFailure`, `Failure.ApiFailure`, `Failure.HttpFailure`,
and `Failure.UnknownFailure`. This allows for simple handling of results through a consistent,
non-exceptional flow via sealed `when` branches.

```kotlin
when (val result = myApi.someEndpoint()) {
  is Success -> doSomethingWith(result.response)
  is Failure -> when (result) {
    is NetworkFailure -> showError(result.error)
    is HttpFailure -> showError(result.code)
    is ApiFailure -> showError(result.error)
    is UnknownError -> showError(result.error)
  }
}
```

Usually, user code for this could just simply show a generic error message for a `Failure`
case, but the sealed subtypes also allow for more specific error messaging or pluggability of error
types.

Simply change your endpoint return type to the typed `ApiResult` and include our call adapter and
delegating converter factory.


```kotlin
interface TestApi {
  @GET("/")
  suspend fun getData(): ApiResult<SuccessResponse, ErrorResponse>
}

val api = Retrofit.Builder()
  .addConverterFactory(ApiResultConverterFactory)
  .addCallAdapterFactory(ApiResultCallAdapterFactory)
  .build()
  .create<TestApi>()
```

If you don't have custom error return types, simply use `Nothing` for the error type.

### Plugability

A common pattern for some APIs is to return a polymorphic `200` response where the data needs to be
dynamically parsed. Consider this example:

```JSON
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {
    ...
  }
}
```

The same API may return this structure in an error event

```JSON
{
  "ok": false,
  "error_message": "Please try again."
}
```

This is hard to model with a single concrete type, but easy to handle with `ApiResult`. Simply
throw an `ApiException` with the decoded error type in a custom Retrofit `Converter` and it will be
automatically surfaced as a `Failure.ApiFailure` type with that error instance.

```kotlin
@GET("/")
suspend fun getData(): ApiResult<SuccessResponse, ErrorResponse>

// In your own converter factory.
class ErrorConverterFactory : Converter.Factory() {
  override fun responseBodyConverter(
    type: Type,
    annotations: Array<out Annotation>,
    retrofit: Retrofit
  ): Converter<ResponseBody, *>? {
    // This returns a `@ResultType` instance that can be used to get the error type via toType()
    val (errorType, nextAnnotations) = annotations.nextAnnotations() ?: error(
      "No error type found!")
    return ResponseBodyConverter(errorType.toType())
  }

  class ResponseBodyConverter(
    private val errorType: Type
  ) : Converter<ResponseBody, *> {
    override fun convert(value: ResponseBody): String {
      if (value.isErrorType()) {
        val errorResponse = ...
        throw ApiException(errorResponse)
      } else {
        return SuccessResponse(...)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

/**
 * Retries a [block] of code with exponential backoff.
 *
 * This function will attempt the operation you give it up to [maxAttempts] times, multiplying the
 * delay between each attempt by [delayFactor], starting from [initialDelay] and not exceeding
 * [maxDelay]. If the operation continues to fail after [maxAttempts] times, it will return the last
 * failure result. If the operation succeeds at any point, it will immediately return the success
 * result.
 *
 * Note: This uses a default exponential backoff strategy with optional jitter. Depending on your
 * use case, you might want to customize the strategy, for example by handling certain kinds of
 * failures differently.
 *
 * @param maxAttempts The maximum number of times to retry the operation.
 * @param initialDelay The delay before the first retry.
 * @param delayFactor The factor by which the delay should increase after each failed attempt.
 * @param maxDelay The maximum delay between retries.
 * @param jitterFactor The maximum factor of jitter to introduce. For example, a value of 0.1 will
 *   introduce up to 10% jitter (both positive and negative).
 * @param onFailure An optional callback for failures, useful for logging.
 * @return The result of the operation if it's successful, or the last failure result if all
 *   attempts fail.
